### 🐾 Why I Started Coding  
One day, I found myself dreaming of something more —  
something I could build, shape, and improve with my own hands.  
So I decided to learn Python as a way to **automate tasks, make tools**,  
and maybe, someday, change the way we work.

DooJJi is always with me while I learn 🐾💗
